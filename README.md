## Telnyx Website Automated Testing with Cypress

This repository contains automated test cases for the Telnyx website using Cypress. The test suite ensures that key features of the website function correctly, focusing on aspects such as the homepage, sign-up form, page links, and other crucial elements of the site.

Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed on your system: Node.js (version 18.x.x recommended), npm, and Cypress (which will be installed with dependencies).

Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/telnyx-tests.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tests

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Running Tests

You can run the Cypress tests in either an interactive mode or a headless mode:
Run tests in Cypress Interactive Mode: This will open the Cypress Test Runner GUI where you can run and debug individual test cases:

npx cypress open

Run tests in Headless Mode: To run all tests without a GUI, use the following command:

npx cypress run

This will run the tests in the Microsoft Edge browser by default, and all results will be displayed directly in the terminal.
